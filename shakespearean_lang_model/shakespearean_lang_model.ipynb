Note that we have chosen to combine the hidden state and next input by means of addition. However, an argument can be made that addition loses some information and hence, concatenation would be a better approach. In addition, we have chosen to reinitialize the hidden state to zero after 8 characters.

It specifies how many hidden layers of our neural network to backpropagate through during the training loop. This becomes important to specify/include in stateful RNNs because the depth of the network is going to become extremely large now that we are not discarding our state information by resetting after every 8 characters. Hence, we do not want to backpropagate through 1000s of layers as its going to be computationally expensive. In additon, it does not make conceptual sense since during backpropagation we are determining how much the error of the output is affected by the activations in a particular layer. In a language model, it is unlikely that the error of the 100000th character output is affected by the first character since it is highly likely that context has changed over 100000 characters."

    "We can see above that our model is starting to approach something resembling Shakespeare like writing. However, we see that towards the end of the sentence the model is starting to produce scrambled and senseless character sequences. This is because as the gap grows between the start and end, even with stateful preservation the vanilla RNN cell has a hard time keeping up with these long term dependencies. Thankfull, NLP researchers have come up with two alternate cells that could be used to remedy this very problem! We will see these two alternate approaches in action below."

    "Instead of using the standard RNN cell (which is simply a linear layer), we will now use a GRU cell. GRU stands for Gated Recurrent Unit and is precisely designed to help with long term dependencies. A GRU cell contains two gates: a reset gate which determines how much of the old hidden state must be preserved and used in combination with current character input and an update gate which determines how much of the new state must be used to create the existing state. One thing to note is that the two gates are mini neural nets themselves (single layer perceptron) with their own weight matrices. The gates' weights are also updated during backpropagation and this is what makes them so effective with long term dependencies."
